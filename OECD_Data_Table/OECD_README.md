This program utilizes panel data on macroeconomic factors for 10 OECD countries recorded at an annual frequency from 1960 to 2013. 
These countries are the United States, Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The data is used to generate a table of stylized facts that highlight the correlation of international real business cycles. 
Additionally, insights such as the varying importance of different factors of GDP consumption, investment, etc, to overall output are discovered.
For example, most of these countries show a strong correlation between output and consumption, whereas Australia shows a relatively low correlation.
This highlights the general trend of developed economies deriving a large share of their output from consumption, which Australia is an outlier to due to its focus on raw resource extraction and exporting.

MATLAB is used to calculate the values of interest, which are exported to Excel for tabular formatting.
